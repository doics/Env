->Black Carbon or soot refers to the solid particle emitted during incomplete combustion of of fossil fuels, biofuels,
 and biomass. BC is the solid fraction of PM2.5 that strongly absorbs light and converts that energy to heat.
Emissions of BC comes from mobile sources especially diesel vehicles, biomass burning (including wildfires),
 residential heating and industry.
It has much shorter life span – a few hours to 20 years than CO2 (lifespan of more than 100 years) but plays 
a far greater role in global warming as it traps more heat. Because of its short lifetime in the atmosphere the
 effects of BC are most important regionally, especially in South and East Asia. Other hotspots occur in Mexico,
 Brazil, Peru, and parts of Africa.
IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEM:
1. Melting of snow and ice, by absorbing heat in the atmosphere and by reducing albedo(the Earth's ability 
to reflect sunlight, when deposited on snow and ice)
2. Interference with cloud formation and changes in precipitation patterns.
3. Reduced agricultural production in some parts of the world.
4. Soiling and damage of material
5. Global temperature change (as it absorb light and convert that energy into heat)
6. Visibility impairment
7. Respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in human beings
Mitigating BC by using clean fuels , making emissions standards for industries and clean and efficient
 household cooking solutions, especially in rural areas could prove effective in slowing down the planet’s warming.
BC currently not being observed as it is not included in Kyoto protocol.(?)


->Bunker Convention (from Intl Maritime organisation) 2001
-Cabinet cleared shipping ministry proposal for India's accession on this @ June 20015
-Will amend the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, to give effect to this ‘bunker convention
-this is into effect internationally form 2008.India not yet a party

Bunker convention (IMO):
1) Adopted in 2001 and came in force in 2008, to ensure that adequate prompt and effective compensation is available to persons who suffer damage caused by oil spills when carried as fuel in ship’sbunkers.
2) It applies to damage caused in territorial and EEZ (200 nautical miles) water, and include state vessel anywhere and foreign vessel in state’s water.
3) Every ship over 1000 tonnes will require to have a insurance certificate to enter or leave India.claim for compensation on pollution damage to be brought directly against an insurer
Benefits:
a) global environmental benefits which includes protection of marine life and effective compensatory mechanisms
b) it has huge implications for Indian trade, now her ships can visit foreign ports with domestic issued certificates (earlier required foreign compliance certificates)
c) protection of its immediate marine environment which is a livelihood source of its residents., 
d) Protection to Indian water from oil spill hazards and will bring out effective compliance standards to be met by owners and manager of vessels.


->Carbon sequestration
-Carbon sequestration is the process of capture and long-term storage of atmospheric CO2
or other form of carbon
-naturally captured from the atmosphere through biological, chemical, or physical processes
-artificial process devised for same using subsurface saline aquifers, reservoirs,
 ocean water, aging oil fields, or other carbon sinks.
-can be done as below biological process
-reforestation
-Wetland soil is an important carbon sink
Agriculture-modified agri process as  soils are estimated to contain large organic carbon
-Reducing emissions + other chemical and physical processes.


->-ve effect of dam constructions
-soil erosion ,
-earth quake due to increase load of technotic
-blasting (esp in himalya region to create artificial lake)
-loss to aquatic life.
-deforestation
-flood
-loss of habitat for wildlife and humans
-_ve effect on river flow and impact on natural filtering process of water
-reduction in waterflow for downstream systems.
-
Proof
-2013 uttarakhand flood , kashmir flood , nepal/india quake 2015
- proven co-relation of desc with construction of Dams like Utrakhand flood 2013
-Scientific Evaluated reports like that of Wildlife Institute of India, CAG Report, G.B. Mukherjee Task Force or Geological Survey of India 
Govt response
-not very good as looking at development perspective only
-shoody implementation of biodiversity act 2002
-not following all standards for EIA
-other ministry creating pressure on Env min for speedy clearances
- Continued attempt to dilute the environmental Laws as recommended by T.S.R. Subramanian Committee
-grant of clearances without looking long term implications

-mean age for marriage has increased 18.3 to 19.3 years for female and 22.6 to 23.3 years for males -2011 census
-fertility declined from 2.5 to 2.2




->Indian desert camels Endangered
Indian camels who are pride of Indian desert in Rajasthan have been threatened owing to anthropogenic factor leading to their inclusion in IUCN red data list. Some of the factors include-
1. Religious factors- With the celebration of Bakarid, smuggling of camels goes on increasing for the demand of camel meat which is wrongly perceived as symbol of celebration in many states. Local religious leaders have not raised their voice among the community as of now.
2. Poor Implementation of govt policies- Govt of karnatka and kerela has made laws in order to curb camel meat. But the ground implementation is poor owing to political- mafia nexus in these areas. Even after rajasthan govt declared it as state animal [AND ENACTED Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export Bill, 2015, which banned the slaughter, trading and unauthorised transportation of camels], steps are not taken to regulate the trade of camels in local fairs such as pushkar.
3. Inaction of administration- Despite of several rulings and orders by High court of madras, administration is not willing to stand up against the mafia operating illegal killings of camel and provide with interstate control over camel trade.
4. Economic reason- with dwindling no. of camels in rajasthan, prices of camels goes on increasing and hence poor nomadic tribes are no longer able to afford camels which is further encouraging the smugglers.
5. Low awareness in public and social media- As it was with the issue of sparrow and vulture, media and public pays low attention unless the species comes to the threat of extinction.

Measures need to be taken- 
0.sensitizing religious leaders to appeal to the masses
1. State govt must take conservation measures in a mission mode as done in past with Project Tiger and Project elephant. 
2. Inter-state cooperation is required to contain the illegal trade across borders. 
3. State govt must put a price cap on Camel trade so as to encourage loal and traditional use of camels. 
4. BSF must encourage more sustainable use of camels on western border hence increasing demands and at the same time controlling smuggling across international border. 
5. Use of technology must be promoted such as done by Assam Govt which used Rhodis DNA database to prevent Rhino poaching. 
6. NGO such as PETA must be coordinated by state govt to promote awareness and if possible make a anti-smuggling force by employing local youth following the lessons from MoEF in Assam.


-> eco-modernists  VS sustainable Development
 -Sustainable development means economic development without depleting 
 natural resources in long term to keep development sustainable
 -Ecological modernism means to use modern technology and efficient method
 to obtain human needs from less harming the nature
 For ex. Pollution control as per Sustainable development contain: Public 
 Transport, lesser usage of vehicles, efficient engines, solar energy usage etc.
 while Ecological modernism will take path of Carbon sequestration, highly efficient engines,
 usage of bio-diesels, hybrid cars 
 Some example of Ecological modernisations are;
1. Carbon Sequestration for CO2 capturing.
2. Raising yields of agriculture and leaving rest of land as forest or dense green cover.
3. Making industries, building more environment friendly ->less energy consumption
4. Keeping storehouse in opposite side of sun, covered with trees, using AC only for high temp
diff
5.Better logistics in transport and road construction. Straight and freeways to 
increase mileage of heavy transport in long distance.

->Green Climate Fund
-Founded As part of UNFCCC framework
-South Korea headquartered
-Proposed corpus of $100-billion promised by developed nation annualy to developing by 2020
-decision to estab @ 2010 Mexico climate conf but yet to start financing projects

Purpose
-to "make a significant and ambitious contribution to the global efforts… to combat climate change
-to use a variety of financial instruments including grants, concessional loans, guarantees and equity for mitigation and adaptation projects

Criticism
-till now(sept 15) only $10B pledged,largest contri US still not formally signed the agree, other  largest contri like Japan,UK , Gemany has already done so
-many things remain unclear:
1) What kind of projects will be funded?
2) What are the returns sought?
3) To what extent will the funding be in the form of grants?
4) Which countries will get more funding: those that are more ready or those that are more needy?
5) Will the funding be new and additional?
6) How will private sector finance be integrated into GCF's operations?
-Eco crisis is detering develop nation contribution
-to give equal voice to develop and developed nation decision making structure has become problem as it has 24 board member which make concensus difficult


Moving forward (?)
--in the agenda items of the last board meeting in July, a discussion on 'decision-making procedures for the board in the absence of consensus'.which can be good move if implemented well.
-Local partners are being accredited in various countries to channel money from the GCF. In India, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) was accredited in July 2015
-this will give them access to GCF and provide a channel for fund transfer.





->Human Compositing
based on principle that Human bodies post death can be Used for giving new Life say plants etc. 
Process
In this process , Human body[ Nitrogen rich] along with Wood chips [carbon rich] are 
placed together along with some catalyst like Nitrogen compost etc for a quick process. 
This becomes bio compost and can be used for vegetation ,plants, improving Humus quality
,soil improvement.Such is based on " nurse logs" where Old decaying logs of tress 
provided/nursed Younger saplings/plants in forest
Merits 
land is luxury it can solve the issue of area required for burials cremation
~Cost effective, Environment friendly
~ Culturally can be accepted as Death can be linked to nature and new life
~For nations relying on Urea , synthetic fertilisers this could be option .
~Also use of natural things rather formaldehyde[ carcinogen] + metal boxes 
~Land for Burials can be now orchids , and areas of vegetation .
Cautions, Demerits, Concerns and Arguments
~ Filling from dental are heavy metal and if mixed with soil can cause trouble 
~ People died from certain disease which even after death remains 
,can be spread to those eating plants from that soil
~religious , and cultural sentiments congruence with rationality is another issue.


->-India Thermal Power plan(TPP) issues
-generates 60% of India’s energy. 
-should be slowly converted into renewable energy to save climate issues.
Some major issues with TPP and actions needed to improve performance and efficiencies are:
(1.) based on old technologies of steam boilers and are lesser efficient. This leads to lesser
 energy for same amount of coal.
(2.) Indian TPP directly use coal mainly Lignite which emits lots of smoke and GHG, developed 
nation, they first convert coal into coke or some intermediate process makes coal more efficient in energy emitting.
(3.) India’s TPP doesn’t burn Coal completely, instead go for efficient use of furnace fire by 
rejecting last steps
for burning. In better performed TPP, they have processes to change burning coal also, to use 80% 
burnt coal in lighting up 
new coal and not generating heat for steam.
Indian TPP rejects this Coal at last stage and leads to heat pollution in water resources and Carbon
 Monoxide formation.
(4.) TPP produces vast amount of flyash because of low quality Indian coal,
mandated to make bricks only of Flyash and cement factory should use flyash but not implemented well.
(5.) Coal handling in Indian mines are mostly manually and in open trucks and train freight, which get exposed
 to moisture and reduces calorific values.




->Integraded Development of Wildlife habitat (IDWH)
-started in 2009
-Improved version of earlier Assistance for Development of National Park & Sancturies programme
-earlier scheme  focus on conservation within Protected Area,IDWH  also includes the outside area.
Goal
- to recover critically endangered species and improve habitat outside protected area (PA)
- to protect corridors and areas adjoining PAs.
-Centrally sponsored. funds being used for habitat-improvement, reducing human-wildlife conflict
-wildlife care and capacity building
what else cam be done
-scientific and ecological assessment of spendings.
-civil societies must also be involved
-govt asked for private funding but not much received
-adopting best practices from world


->National air quality index [NAQI]
-to give real time pollution data to increase awareness about health risk
-will take data from CPCB and SPCB and present in easy to understand
color coded scheme[Green for safe levels and progreesively reddish as 
limits are breached]
- divided into different ranges from 0-50 as good, 50-100 as moderate etc
-cosider PM2.5 and PM10 as particular matter to access pollution level
+Nitrogen , co , so+o3

Critics
- NAQI by itself is simply not enough in the fight to bring down pollution
 levels in the country
-like in Beijing when pollution threshold warning is given govt limit cars
 on roads, close polluting industry , close schools etc.
-NAQI falls short of the standards set by the WHO [PM 2.5 tolerance level
 is 50 mcg/cubic m intl is 40]

suggestion
-encourage public transport
-carbon tax
-dedicated cycle lane
-congestion tax on busy cities with more vehicle
-Battery operated rikshaw and encourage batter operated cars

->Why PM2.5 considered dangerous
-Summary : can go to lungs and blood stream , everyone effected rich poor etc.

Particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is a term, which is used for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air that are less than 2.5 micrometers in size. These fine particles are largely produced by fuel combustion, power plants, and diesel buses and trucks. Given that PM 2.5 is a 1000 times finer than the human hair, it has the ability to reach deep into the lungs and bloodstream. The following are some recorded health problems associated with PM2.5:
(A) Premature death;
(B) Acute respiratory symptoms, including aggravated coughing and painful breathing;
(C) Aggravated asthma;
(D) Chronic bronchitis;
(E) Cardio-vascular diseases
(F) Increased cancer risk

What makes PM2.5 pollution especially dangerous in urban regions including India is its ubiquitous nature. It affects every individual irrespective of whether they are rich or poor and lead a healthy lifestyle or not. Despite the the inauguration of the National Air Quality Index, scant attention has been paid to making use of its data for furthering human health. For e.g, measures like declaration of air pollution emergencies on days of high pollution are yet to be taken despite the well documented consequences of exposure to pollution.

Taking into account all the above factors, it is amply clear that PM2.5 pollution is major challenge to public health in urban areas. It is time for the government to sit up and take notice of the same for a healthy population is the sine qua non for reaping the benefits of demographic dividend.



->NGT banning 10 yr old diesal vehicle in Delhi
-to reduce pollution in most polluted city in the world
-Why only diesel
-diesel one emit less CO2 than petrol but more NOx - dangerous even for 
healthy person.
-combustion capacity of diesel is less so more pollution.->small particles can
 penetrate into lungs.
Long term exposure of diesel to any person, is seen to lead to lung cancer.
-Catalytic converters in petrol cars can convert the CO into CO2, which is 
lesser harmful. 
These converters works good at higher temperature but Diesel engine is 
relatively cooler.
- Diesel cars have much higher emission of nitrous oxides and particulate matter (more
dangerous than CO2 emission.) which can damage respiratory system and cause irritation
 in eyes and nasal cavity,asthma
-NOx compounds and finer particles like hydrocarbons creates the ground level ozone 
-Decade old engine don't have to follow bharat 4 standards so more pollution

NGT
-under National Green Tribunal Act,2010
-to safeguard Article 21 of consititution (Right to Life)
-aim to provide protection to environment,conservation of forests and other natural resources 
-quasi judicial body ,can take environmental violation cases from public spaces and penalise the perpetrator party
-enforcement of legal rights for environment(to relieve SC/HC) and giving relief and compensation for damages to persons and property.-
\
Steps taken
-ban on entry of diesel vehicle in delhi -more than 10 yrs old
-ban on public burning of waste
-ban on pollution from contruction activities and guidelines around that
-cancellation of coal block clearance in Hasdee-Arand forests overriding central government's 
-Sterlite case and Meghalaya rat hole mining.
-Proposed plan for rejuvenating the Yamuna river for 52km stretch in Delhi and UP region.
critical analysis
-limited capacity can't enforce its orders so require support from govt and pollution conrol board.
-long pending cases , less staff so mandatory 6 months guidelines to finish trial don't hold water.
- lack of effective support from government both at the centre as well in states
-Inefficiency  of central and state pollution control board
-this leads to delays in implementing the tribunal's decision
- long list of pending cases in the tribunal
-dont have sue motto power which restrict it embit w.r.t environment

->Remedial to clean oil spills
-Dispersant used to clear 2010 deep water oil spills in gulf of mexico
- 5 million barrels of oil leak
The basic approaches for removing the oil from the water were: 
•	burning the oil, 
•	filtering offshore
•	collecting for later processing
•	use of dispersant
-Dispersants are chemical emulsifiers, it helps oil to easily mix with water 
and hence increases the rate of oil dispersion
{Mechanism of action of dispersants used:
•	On contact with the dispersant, oil that would otherwise float on the surface of 
the water is emulsified into tiny droplets and sinks or remains suspended in the water. 
•	allows the oil to be more rapidly degraded by bacteria (bioremediation) and 
prevents it from accumulating on beaches and in marshes.}}
_ve in this case
- dispersants were applied at depth considering it will reduce pollution quickly  much of 
the oil never rose to the surface.
-Dispersant itself is toxic compared to oil
-SPread fast , its effect observed even at corals where there was no oil spill.	
- coral populations were coated with a dark-coloured flocculent slime that was found to
 contain oil from the spill and residues from the dispersants
-Because of harm to coral other fishes are also contaminated and dieing prematurely
-Dispersants at lower concentration were harming corals much than the oil 
- Dolphins and Turtle infants are dying many times more than usual figures.

->-According to Supreme Court orders on November 13, 2000 and May 9, 2002, land
 in a sanctuary or national park cannot be diverted or non-forest activities 
 undertaken without the court’s specific approval before placing it to NBWL committee.
-time consuming as every user agency has to approach local authorities, chief wildlife
 warden, State Board for Wildlife (SBWL), the standing committee of National Board for 
 Wildlife (NBWL) and then to seek specific permission of this Hon’ble Court.”
-govt say earlier to alter bounderies state legislature approval was required but 2003
amendment in wildlife protection act 
-sanctuary bouner alteration after consultation with state boards for wildlife (SBWL)
-national park after national board for wildlife (NBWL)
-100% FDI in railways
-Earth hour org by world wide fund for nature. last sunday @ 8.30-9.30 pm

to be noted for today
WS:People are not allowed to live (some exceptions though) but some human activities are allowed, such as grazing, firewood collection.
Tourism is permitted.
A Sanctuary can be upgraded as a National Park. However a National Park cannot be downgraded as a Sanctuary.

->-Bioremediation v/s Scientific closure method of waste management.
Treating, Segregating Muncipal waste has been big problem as with various safety norms by govt to work 
in dumpyards and various proneness to diseases like pulmonary, skin allergy etc. While Scientific Closure
means, segregating biological or decomposable garbage and fetching methane from it’s decomposition. 
While, Bioremediation means, treating the whole garbage mass with process like vermicompost or decomposing
it with micro-organisim.
 Preference to “Scientific Closure” for Recycling process is done because of following reasons:
(1.) Bioremediation is time consuming also, while Scientific Closure is short period.
(2.) Bioremediation emits methane to environment which is a GHG gas, while SC collects Methane
 to use it as Biogas for fuel.this Methane can also be used to earn carbon credits under kyoto protocol.
(3.) SC decomposed items are often organic material which can be used as manure composite, while Bioremediaiton,
 once it’s eaten by worms, it is left of lesser use.
4 )in bioremidation organic contaminants may not be broken down fully resulting in toxic by-products and
problem of disposal after the process is complete
Hence, SC is preferred to Bioremediation., but first time infrastructure cost of Scientific closure is one
obstruction in front of Muncipal corporation So MC can adopt this along with sort at generation site system.


->Teraethyl Lead (TEL)-

· TEL is an organolead compound(chemical compounds containing a chemical bond between carbon and lead). It is a toxic colorless synthetically made oily liquid and was mixed with leaded petrol in 1920s as a patented octane booster/ anti-knocking agent that allowed engine compression to be raised substantially, which helped in increasing vehicle performance or fuel economy.
· But its negative impact related to neurotoxicity (lead poisoning), damaging effect on catalytic converters and were main cause for spark plug fouling which lead to start of its phase out in 1970s
· Currently, it is still used as an additive in some grades of aviation gasoline and in some developing countries

Biopurification:
· It is the natural process of exclusion of harmful elements from human body (to maintain optimum level) that has evolved through millions of years of human evolution.
· For example: Calcium and Barium are found in tandem. While calcium is useful for us, barium is poisonous. Our body has evolved in such a way that it produces protein that effectively absorbs calcium while being almost ineffective for Barium
· According to concept of biopurification, natural concentration of harmful elements in human body should be far lower than toxic levels


Water crisis in India [water is state subject]
-1. Most of the cultivated land in India is still dependent upon rainfall
2.Lack of access to drinking water ,preventable deaths like diarrhoea in children.
3. Interstate and Intrastate conflicts. For example Kaveri river dispute.
4. Groundwater level has been reducing
5. Rivers continue to remain polluted.powai lake declared unfit for drinking.
6. India sees a double irony of flood and drought together in different parts.
The reasons for such a grim situation are:
1. Lack of proper irrigation facilities 
-subsiding of water pumps.
2. Little action taken to detoxify rivers and lakes which are sources of freshwater.
3. Erratic monsoon and population explosion coupled with migration
4. Lack of adequate treatment facilities 
5. The water usability index of Indian rivers is lower than expected.
6. Industries like coal based power plants are huge consumers of water cooling and rotating turbines.
7. Prevalence of water intensive crops water deficit areas.
steps taken
1. Community based rainwater harvesting, check dams.
2. Sensitization and awareness amongst people for juducious use of water and avoid wastage.
3. Increasing storage facilities, but this means more dams. So adequate environmental and rehabilitation issues need to be taken care of.
4. Building canal networks to supply water from surplus zone to deficit zone.
5. Treatment of industrial effluents before going to rivers.strict implementation of laws
6. Increased participation of NGOs and subsidising water treatment facilities. 
7. Shift towards renewable energy 
8.Nationsl Water Policy 2012 aims to establish a regulator, prioritize water allocation as per nature of needs, treat water as an economic good for conservation, encourage water management techniques. But it has been criticized for shiftinf in favour of privatisation of water supply and not providing for polluter pays principle rather ot gives incentived for effluent treatment.
